842048892892004353,2017-03-15 16:24:35,@theonevortex Market data says segwit not happening. I'm not using a crystal ball.
842048623122743296,2017-03-15 16:23:30,"@theonevortex No, that's the code for Segwit. That's what the code says matters. Again, fair to judge by what it says."
842048297850281985,2017-03-15 16:22:13,"@theonevortex So which is it, can you judge the future by the past or not? Because you're holding one belief for BU, another for Segwit."
842048101619769345,2017-03-15 16:21:26,@theonevortex Goal post was set when the core devs created BIP0144. It's completely fair to judge by that standard.
842047851731521536,2017-03-15 16:20:27,"@theonevortex I agree, and that's why you can't make guarantees like ""Core will always Peer Review and Q/A properly"". future is unknowable."
842047650400743425,2017-03-15 16:19:39,@theonevortex I'm fixated on what the core devs' criteria laid out beforehand. You can't move the goal posts now.
842047389577957377,2017-03-15 16:18:36,"@theonevortex If you can make such guarantees, open-sourcing does not add anything. The point is you can't make such guarantees."
842047169527971840,2017-03-15 16:17:44,"@theonevortex Hey, I didn't make the activation % the criteria, the Core devs did. I'm fixating on what they told me to fixate on."
842046898089414657,2017-03-15 16:16:39,"@theonevortex Again, can you guarantee that going forward? If so, might as well make core closed-source."
842046721748307970,2017-03-15 16:15:57,"@theonevortex And based on the factors at hand, Segwit is also dead. If you apply the same criteria they're in the same state."
842046535533789184,2017-03-15 16:15:13,@theonevortex Are you seriously guaranteeing that no mistakes will ever be made? You said the future cannot be assumed 2 B like the present
842046204917764097,2017-03-15 16:13:54,@theonevortex You just said you can't assume the future will remain like the present. Or does that only apply to things favoring your side?
842045709469769729,2017-03-15 16:11:56,"@theonevortex If that's the case, you can't declare BU dead, can you?"

842045379378049025,2017-03-15 16:10:37,"@theonevortex We've discussed this before. Segwit isn't activating, therefore, all that work going into Segwit is wasted."
842045249497227266,2017-03-15 16:10:06,"@theonevortex And that's the problem. you think BU is dead Segwit is alive, the other side vice-versa. That's why there's no consensus."
842044916947644417,2017-03-15 16:08:47,The saddest part of this whole scaling debate is the wasting of Bitcoin's most precious resource: developer time.

842033314844278784,2017-03-15 15:22:41,UASF and HF have this in common: give users a choice! Both disregard the fact that giving users a choice at consensus level is very costly.

841798717292347393,2017-03-14 23:50:28,@kristovatlas Please clarify. Who's the victim and what damages did the victim suffer?

837066122776227840,2017-03-01 22:24:50,@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge I reject the change that introduces the tech debt.
837065980203450368,2017-03-01 22:24:16,@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge So is the answer yes or no? Are you opposing a hypothetical SF that has too much debt by not running it?
837063921320275972,2017-03-01 22:16:05,"@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge And if by not running it, you're preventing the SF from going through, would you characterize yourself as opposing it?"
837063252844625921,2017-03-01 22:13:26,@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge Or if your assessment is that it's too big to reduce reasonably?
837063125799153664,2017-03-01 22:12:55,@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge And if your tech debt reduction isn't accepted?
837062205107539968,2017-03-01 22:09:16,"@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge So if during your verification of a SF that tech debt isn't too big, you find that it is too big, what do you do?"
837061940576940032,2017-03-01 22:08:13,@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge You're not answering my question. I'm not asking about 2010. I'm asking about how you ensure tech debt is well managed.
837061093939892229,2017-03-01 22:04:51,@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge Then how do you enforce that devs are managing tech debt well?
837060762061398017,2017-03-01 22:03:32,"@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge If you trust the devs that much, you wouldn't care if it was closed source. I say you should verify. What's ridiculous?"
837058900398604288,2017-03-01 21:56:08,"@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge If Bitcoin were closed-source, would you trust it? Then, why would you not scrutinize implementations?"
837058332926017537,2017-03-01 21:53:53,@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge You assume devs will always act responsibly. You don't know the future. Bad assumption.
837057965781893120,2017-03-01 21:52:25,"@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge Depends on what you mean by ""use"". Forced acceptance of blocks that have segwit, that's not like a market."
837057482614845440,2017-03-01 21:50:30,@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge Of course it's my problem. What happens if no one wants to maintain the code b/c too much tech debt?
837056556634157056,2017-03-01 21:46:49,"@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge Read my tweets again. I'm answering your question generally about SFs, not specifically segwit."
837056397997146112,2017-03-01 21:46:11,"@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge You oppose layers on top by not using them. You know, like a market, not like a government."
837056231932112896,2017-03-01 21:45:32,"@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge I was giving reasons for possible objections, I never said those were my objections to any SF, let alone segwit."
837055994672869382,2017-03-01 21:44:35,@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge There's no practical difference. A soft fork cannot be executed without an implementation. Opposing on that is fine.
837055407201878016,2017-03-01 21:42:15,@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge Adds too much technical debt. Changes economic incentives. Adds too much attack surface. Adds HF risks.
837054707663269893,2017-03-01 21:39:28,@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge One reason to oppose a soft-fork (in general not segwit in particular) would be because the code for it has bugs.
837054536787324940,2017-03-01 21:38:47,"@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge I'm a bitcoin realist, so I'm looking at what bitcoin will be, not what I wish it to be. That said, I'll take a stab."
837053252894093315,2017-03-01 21:33:41,"@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge All changes to bitcoin itself need consensus, thus are not permission-less. You can build whatever you want on top, tho"

837050199918931973,2017-03-01 21:21:33,@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge So anyone who's opposing you is attacking the network. Any difference of opinion is invalid. Are you hearing yourself?
837048278004948992,2017-03-01 21:13:55,"@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge Those ""outdated practices"" got bitcoin to where it is today. You're throwing the baby out with the bathwater."
837047770351546368,2017-03-01 21:11:54,"@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge Again, you seem to think all users are for segwit. Try listening to your opponents instead of demonizing them."
837047025447362562,2017-03-01 21:08:57,"@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge Like it or not, consensus is how bitcoin gets upgrades. Ignore consensus at your peril."
837043502722740230,2017-03-01 20:54:57,"@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge No, actually, the burden of implementation is entirely on the people who present the idea. That's how consensus works."
837043204184756225,2017-03-01 20:53:46,"@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge If you can't convince me, a bitcoin realist, how can you possibly hope to get consensus?"
837042957706489866,2017-03-01 20:52:47,@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge You really need to listen to more opinions. It's a lot more people than Ver + a few weirdos.
837042475575422977,2017-03-01 20:50:52,"@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge Really, you're going to call the roundtable the entire bitcoin community?"
837042276773715968,2017-03-01 20:50:04,"@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge If you think a vast majority support segwit, I think you need to come out of your echo chamber."
837042121941086213,2017-03-01 20:49:28,@AlpacaSW @Falkvinge I find your dismissal of community sentiment a little concerning. I'm only predicting based on evidence and trends.
