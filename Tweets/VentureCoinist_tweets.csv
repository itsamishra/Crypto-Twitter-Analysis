920806206377046016,2017-10-19 00:18:02,Every one of my threads are very simple ideas. I find the simplest explanations and tips to be most effective.

920805713080750080,2017-10-19 00:16:04,"17/ Tough part here is not getting greedy with alt gains. Wait too long and $BTC starts to correct (weaken) significantly, bring alts down 2"
920805668738572288,2017-10-19 00:15:53,"16/ And swing back into long $BTC, selling expensive alts to buy $BTC when it becomes cheap again."
920805538572640256,2017-10-19 00:15:22,15/ Think of the ideal short/long exposure like a pendulum. The long exposure should shift to alts as $BTC is done with it's strong run
920805504607072257,2017-10-19 00:15:14,"14/ This seems simple, yet traders (I've been guilty before) still sell weaker alts to strong $BTC 

or 

buy stronger alts with weak $BTC"
920805453499572225,2017-10-19 00:15:02,13/ Similarly you would scale out of stronger alts when expensive &gt; into weaker $BTC (cheaper) getting more bang for your Alt-coin
920805315305553920,2017-10-19 00:14:29,"12/ Rather than try to time this exactly at top or bottom (impossible), it makes sense to scale into alts as $BTC gets relatively expensive"
920805280408944640,2017-10-19 00:14:21,11/ ...when $BTC is strongest (expensive) and buy alts when they are weakest (cheapest). You are getting most bang for your $BTC
920805242265944065,2017-10-19 00:14:12,"10/ As $BTC approaches top of channel and has higher chance of reaching resistance, you have opportunity to exchange your $BTC for alts..."
920805184451706880,2017-10-19 00:13:58,"9/ Another way to think of this is the alts are becoming weaker (cheaper) in terms of $BTC. 

You could buy 100 $LTC yesterday -&gt; 120 today"
920805125618151424,2017-10-19 00:13:44,"8/ Each day $BTC gets stronger (more expensive), it can buy more alts than previous day. 

$5100 worth of alt yesterday -&gt; $5500 worth today"
920804980784635904,2017-10-19 00:13:09,"7/ Since almost all alts are priced in $BTC, you see their price drop as $BTC rises to top of channel. $BTC becomes stronger (expensive)"
920804946890518528,2017-10-19 00:13:01,6/ To keep things simple assume your portfolio is only composed of $BTC and alts. I also use long/short interchangeably for buy/sell
