Don't be easily fooled!😁"
820339696131719168,2017-01-14 18:39:59,"18/ And even if the #CentralBank did that, how would the new #DigitalCurrency compete against #Bitcoin today?

820337956334374912,2017-01-14 18:33:04,16/ My analysis is that #CentralBank issued #DigitalCurrencies will most likely look &amp; behave just like #FiatMoney today. No new innovation.
820337312651350016,2017-01-14 18:30:31,15/ Will recipients of this digital currency be assured of no chargeback? Or are their funds always subject to reversals or account freezes?
820336866134065152,2017-01-14 18:28:44,14/ Will they truly allow autonomous &amp; unchecked money transfers with no limits? Or will payments &amp; transfers be subject to review &amp; limits?
820335775019454464,2017-01-14 18:24:24,"13/ So maybe this so-called new #CentralBank #DigitalCurrency is just to improve settlement &amp; transfer?
Why even need #Blockchain at all?"
820334785528664066,2017-01-14 18:20:28,"12/ Still no protection from future #hyperinflation as there are no caps &amp; limits on circulation amount, &amp; no governance on supply creation."

No diff!"
820333715960139776,2017-01-14 18:16:13,"10/ Next question is obvious: Should they always retain control of the currency, or set the rules in stone &amp; allow no more changes forever?"
820332684933115904,2017-01-14 18:12:07,"9/ Again, the 1st &amp; most important question would be:
In #CentralBank #DigitalCurrencies, will they insist on ASSIGNING us #PrivateKeys?🤔👎👎👎"
820330889255100416,2017-01-14 18:04:59,"8/ But this NO would mean

- No freezing accounts
- Unlimited accounts for people"
820330359690694656,2017-01-14 18:02:53,"7/ If answer is NO and account numbers are freely generated, as in #Bitcoin today, then we have true: Secret, Secure, Digital #PrivateKeys."

- Identity judged by people
- No need for #PrivateKey"

Is that #DigitalCurrency?"
820328042329358337,2017-01-14 17:53:40,"4/ YES also mean that govt can &amp; will have access to digital #PrivateKey, enabling full control &amp; censorship:

820327169784090624,2017-01-14 17:50:12,"3/ Would they want to control account creation &amp; assign them to people?

YES means Real IDs tied to all accounts. Same as cur. bank accounts"
