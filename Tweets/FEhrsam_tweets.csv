892587343785349121,2017-08-02 03:26:20,"5/ So lower friction to move between blockchain worlds (@polkadotnetwork) and tokens (@0xProject) = more innovation, diversity, freedom."
892586136664555523,2017-08-02 03:21:33,4/ Blockchains: forking is a tradeoff. Value to being on the same network. But also value in allowing different views and trying new ideas.
892585842379587589,2017-08-02 03:20:22,"3/ Web 2.0: centralized companies make forking near impossible. Can‚Äôt overcome incumbent network effects, innovation slows, freedom shrinks."

892585578067148800,2017-08-02 03:19:19,1/ This is the second time forking has created value (the sum of the forks is greater than the prior whole).
892430620277710849,2017-08-01 17:03:35,11/ So best to keep and open mind so you can experience the best the blockchain multiverse has to offer!
892430566775078912,2017-08-01 17:03:22,10/ It‚Äôs likely different blockchains are best at doing different things in the long run.

892430050657583105,2017-08-01 17:01:19,3/ Crypto tribalism plays out in two common ways: 1) people promoting their own currency and 2) people discrediting other currencies.
892430007452160000,2017-08-01 17:01:08,2/ Crypto tribalism can be seen on reddit every day. Subreddits generate and report news that support their holdings.
892429946550837248,2017-08-01 17:00:54,"1/ Cryptocurrencies create strong tribalism. Once you own a currency, your incentives are to make that currency go up in value."
